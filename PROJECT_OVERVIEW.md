## 1. Software Architect Perspective

From an architectural standpoint, the system is designed as a modular, extensible framework for backtesting cryptocurrency trading strategies. The core principles are separation of concerns, flexibility, and ease of use.

### 1.1. System Architecture

The application is broken down into five main components, each with a distinct responsibility. This modular design makes the system easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[main.py] --> B(Data Fetcher);
    A --> C(Data Processor);
    A --> D(Strategy);
    A --> E(Backtesting Engine);
    E --> F(Performance Metrics);
    E --> G(Visualization);
    F --> H[CSV Reports];

    subgraph "Data Pipeline"
        B; C;
    end

    subgraph "Strategy Execution"
        D; E;
    end

    subgraph "Results & Analysis"
        F; G; H;
    end

    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**Component Responsibilities:**

*   **`main.py` (Orchestrator):** The entry point of the application. It has been refactored to focus on running a single, highly configurable strategy (`HMA_WAE`). It coordinates the actions of all other components, from fetching data for a specific symbol and timeframe to running the backtest and generating reports.
*   **Data Fetcher (`src/data/data_fetcher.py`):** Responsible for acquiring historical price data. It includes a fallback mechanism (Yahoo Finance -> Binance) and a caching layer to improve performance and reduce external API calls.
*   **Data Processor (`src/data/data_processor.py`):** Cleans the raw data and enriches it with technical indicators and return calculations, preparing it for the strategies.
*   **Strategy (`src/strategy/`):** Implements the trading logic. A `BaseStrategy` abstract class defines a common interface, and concrete strategies (e.g., `SMAStrategy`, `RSIStrategy`) provide the specific rules for generating buy/sell signals. This is a classic example of the **Strategy Design Pattern**.
*   **Backtesting Engine (`src/backtesting/engine.py`):** The core of the application. It simulates the execution of trades based on the signals generated by a strategy, accounting for factors like commission and slippage. Individual trades are stored as `Trade` dataclass objects.
*   **Performance Metrics (`src/backtesting/metrics.py`):** Calculates a wide range of metrics (e.g., Sharpe ratio, Sortino Ratio, Calmar Ratio, max drawdown) to evaluate the performance of a strategy. The results are encapsulated in a `BacktestResults` dataclass and can be exported to detailed CSV files for both performance summaries and individual trade logs.
*   **Visualization (`src/visualization/charts.py`):** Generates visual reports, including equity curves, and saves them as image files in the `results` directory.

### 1.2. Data Pipeline

The data pipeline is designed to be robust and efficient.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Fetch Request] --> B{Cache Check};
    B -- Hit --> C[Load from Parquet];
    B -- Miss --> D{Fetch from Binance};
    D -- Success --> E[Save to Cache];
    D -- Failure --> F{Fetch from Yahoo Finance};
    F -- Success --> E;
    F -- Failure --> G[Error];
    C --> H(Data Processor);
    E --> H;
```

*   **Data Sources:** The primary data source is Binance, with Yahoo Finance used as a fallback, providing redundancy.
*   **Caching:** Successfully fetched data is stored in the `data/cache` directory as Parquet files. This is a highly efficient columnar storage format that significantly speeds up subsequent data loading. The cache has a configurable expiry time.
*   **Processing:** The `DataProcessor` cleans the data (handles NaNs, validates prices) and then calculates a standard set of technical indicators and returns. This pre-calculation saves computation time during the backtest.

### 1.3. Backtesting Engine Design

The engine follows a simple, vectorized event-driven model. It iterates through each timestamp in the dataset and processes the trading signal for that point in time.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A(Start Backtest) --> B{For each Timestamp};
    B --> C{Get Signal from pre-computed Series};
    C -- "Buy/Sell (1 or -1)" --> D{Position Open?};
    D -- No --> E[Open Position];
    D -- Yes --> F{"Is Signal a Reversal? (e.g. from 1 to -1)"};
    F -- Yes --> G[Close Position];
    G --> E;
    F -- No --> H[Hold Position];
    C -- "Close/Hold (0)" --> I{Position Open?};
    I -- Yes --> J[Close Position];
    I -- No --> H[Hold Position];
    J --> B;
    E --> B;
    H --> B;
    B -- End of Data --> K(Generate Final Results & Reports);
```

*   **State Management:** The `Backtester` class maintains the state of the portfolio at all times, including capital, current position (long, short, or flat), and trade history. Each trade is recorded in a `Trade` object, capturing details like entry/exit times, prices, and P&L.
*   **Trade Execution:** The engine simulates trades by opening and closing positions based on the signals. It incorporates slippage and commission to provide more realistic results.
*   **Position Sizing:** A fixed fractional position sizing strategy is used (35% of available capital per trade). This is a simple approach to money management.
*   **Assumptions & Limitations:**
    *   **Market Orders:** The engine assumes all trades are executed as market orders at the closing price of the bar.
    *   **Fixed Slippage/Commission:** These are modeled as fixed percentages, which may not reflect real market conditions accurately.
    *   **No Partial Fills:** The engine assumes all orders are filled completely.

## 2. Software Developer Perspective

This section provides practical information for developers working with the codebase.

### 2.1. Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd crypto_backtester
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the main script:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    This will run a backtest for the HMA+WAE strategy on `BTC-USD` using an 8-hour timeframe by default. The configuration (Symbol, Timeframe) can be easily changed within `main.py`. Results are saved in the `results` folder.

### 2.1.1. Configuration Examples

**Change Symbol and Timeframe:**
```python
# In main.py, modify these lines:
SYMBOL = "ETH-USD"        # Try ETH, ADA, DOT, etc.
TIMEFRAME = "4h"          # Try 1h, 4h, 8h, 1d, etc.
DATA_PERIOD = "1y"        # Try 6mo, 1y, 2y, 3y
```

**Test Different Strategies:**
```python
# Replace the HMA-WAE strategy with others:
from src.strategy import create_sma_strategy, create_rsi_strategy

# SMA Crossover strategy
strategy = create_sma_strategy(fast_period=10, slow_period=30)

# RSI Mean Reversion strategy  
strategy = create_rsi_strategy(period=14, oversold=30, overbought=70)
```

**Customize HMA-WAE Parameters:**
```python
strategy = create_hma_wae_strategy(
    hma_period=21,           # Hull MA period (default: 21)
    wae_sensitivity=150,     # WAE sensitivity (default: 150)  
    wae_fast_length=20,      # Fast EMA length (default: 20)
    wae_slow_length=40,      # Slow EMA length (default: 40)
    wae_bb_length=20,        # Bollinger Bands length (default: 20)
    wae_bb_mult=2.0,         # BB multiplier (default: 2.0)
    trade_direction="both",   # "long", "short", or "both"
    lag_tolerance=2          # Signal lag tolerance (default: 2)
)

### 2.2. Project Structure

### 2.3. How to Add a New Strategy

Creating a new trading strategy is straightforward:

1.  **Create a new class** in `src/strategy/strategies.py` that inherits from `BaseStrategy`.
2.  **Implement the `generate_signals` method.** This method takes a pandas DataFrame (with OHLCV and indicators) as input and must return a pandas Series of signals (`1` for buy, `-1` for sell, `0` for hold).
3.  **Add a convenience function** in `strategies.py` to create an instance of your new strategy.
4.  **Integrate it** into `main.py` by replacing the existing strategy.

**Example: A Simple "Buy and Hold" Strategy**

```python
# In src/strategy/strategies.py, add the new class and function:

class BuyAndHoldStrategy(BaseStrategy):
    """A simple buy and hold strategy."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("BuyAndHold")
        
    def generate_signals(self, data: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
        """Buy on the first day and hold."""
        signals = pd.Series(0, index=data.index, dtype=float)
        signals.iloc[0] = 1.0  # Buy signal on the first bar
        return signals

def create_buy_and_hold_strategy() -> BuyAndHoldStrategy:
    """Creates a Buy and Hold Strategy instance."""
    return BuyAndHoldStrategy()

# In main.py, update the strategy creation part:

# Import the new function at the top
from src.strategy import create_buy_and_hold_strategy

# ... later in the main() function ...

# 3. Create the new strategy
print("\n🎯 Creating Buy and Hold strategy...")
strategy = create_buy_and_hold_strategy()

# The rest of the script runs the backtest for this strategy
```

### 2.4. Key Libraries and Tools

*   **`pandas`:** The backbone of the application for data manipulation and analysis.
*   **`yfinance` & `requests`:** Used for fetching data from external APIs.
*   **`ta`:** A comprehensive library for calculating technical analysis indicators.
*   **`matplotlib` & `seaborn`:** Used for creating high-quality visualizations.
*   **`pyarrow`:** For efficient Parquet file caching.
*   **`logging`:** Used for providing informative output during the execution of the backtest.
