# MVP Roadmap: Advanced HMA-WAE Trading System

## System Overview

This is a **focused, production-ready** cryptocurrency backtesting framework built exclusively around the **Advanced HMA-WAE (Hull Moving Average + Waddah Attar Explosion) Hybrid Trading Strategy**.

## ✅ COMPLETED: Core System

### Foundation
- ✅ Professional modular architecture (`src/` structure)
- ✅ Multi-source data pipeline (Binance/Yahoo Finance with caching)
- ✅ Fixed backtesting engine with realistic trading costs
- ✅ Comprehensive performance metrics (20+ indicators)

### HMA-WAE Strategy Implementation
- ✅ Advanced HMA-WAE strategy matching TradingView Pine Script exactly
- ✅ Multiple HMA modes (HMA, EHMA, THMA)
- ✅ Sophisticated WAE momentum confirmation system
- ✅ Position state tracking preventing consecutive entries
- ✅ Configurable trade directions (long/short/both)

### Parameter Optimization System
- ✅ Parallel grid search optimization
- ✅ Deployment readiness scoring algorithm
- ✅ Train/test split validation (70/30)
- ✅ Automated deployment recommendations (DEPLOY/TEST_MORE/REJECT)
- ✅ Standalone optimization examples

### Integration & Testing
- ✅ Clean main.py workflow
- ✅ Comprehensive test validation
- ✅ Professional documentation and usage guides
- ✅ Results visualization and export

## 🎯 NEXT: Code Cleanup & Simplification

### Objective: Single-Strategy Focus
Remove all non-HMA-WAE components to create the leanest possible codebase:

- 🗑️ **Remove unused strategies**: SMA, RSI, Bollinger Bands, Legacy HMA-WAE
- 🗑️ **Remove strategy selection logic**: Only one strategy exists
- 🧹 **Simplify configuration**: Focus parameters on HMA-WAE only
- 📝 **Update documentation**: Remove multi-strategy references

### Expected Benefits
- **~400 fewer lines of code** (from ~1,600 to ~1,200 lines)
- **Zero confusion** - single strategy to understand
- **Faster execution** - no unused imports or classes
- **Focused documentation** - everything HMA-WAE specific

## 🚀 Production Ready

The system is already **production-ready** for HMA-WAE trading with:
- Realistic trading simulation (commission, slippage, position sizing)
- Professional-grade optimization with deployment scoring
- Comprehensive backtesting validation
- Clean, maintainable codebase architecture
